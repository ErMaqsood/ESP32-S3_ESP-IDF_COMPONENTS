# ESP-IDF SPI Peripheral Components
Welcome to the SPI peripheral components library with ESP-IDF support.  This library of components is relatively active and updated on a regular basis and a list of operational components and the state of each component under development is available below.

ESP-IDF SPI device peripheral components supported at this time are listed as follows:
 
 - Analog Devices MAX31865 - Work in Progress

Components are developed when needed for product development and/or prototyping purposes, and shared with the ESP32 community for ESP-IDF developers.  Custom component development is available upon request, please contact me directly, and I would be happy to discuss the details of your component needs.  If any problems arise please feel free to log an issue and if you would to contribute please contact me.
