Components are developed when needed for product development and/or prototyping purposes, and shared with the ESP32 community for ESP-IDF developers\&. Custom component development is available upon request, please contact me directly, and I would be happy to discuss the details of your component needs\&. If any problems arise please feel free to log an issue and if you would to contribute please contact me\&.
